# pleaseR2

so excited that it's kind of working.  

1.  R.YML - this file sets up the ubuntu server with R.  Right now it only does a single install so you will need to add to this. It calls:
2.  R_Checker.R - this is R code that just executes.


There are other YAML files and docker files that are not really needed.  

Next steps:

1.  Move this to a new code repo with a normal name.
2.  Run the code and make sure it still works.
3.  Integrate Alex's code into the R script
4.  You will need to check in some pretend code. I think if you can get 1 problem working - that's probably good enough.

Gradescope
1. Set up Assignment 2 in your test section as a program assignment
2. Upload Alex's script as part of the zip file 
3. Upload an R assignment and autograde
